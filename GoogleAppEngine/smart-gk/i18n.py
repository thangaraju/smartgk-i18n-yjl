# Internationlization of Django
# =============================
#
# Here we assume that you don't run entire Django framework. In the entry
# script, we need to configure correctly in order to get Django's i18n worked.
# Please read the imports in this script.
#
# Then we will need to specify what string needs to be translated, please
# refer to http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/0.96/i18n/
#
# Next step is to generate message files. In order to get the Django's utility
# worked, we will need to create few directories:
#
#   $ mkdir -p /path/to/myapp/conf/locale
#
# Run make-messages.py
#
#   $ cd /path/to/myapp
#   $ PYTHONPATH=/path/to/googleappengine/lib/django/ /path/to/googleappengine/lib/django/django/bin/make-messages.py -l en
#
# Where /path/to/googleappengine is the location of Google App Engine SDK.
# Now we should have /path/to/conf/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/django.po. Create
# languages as many as we need and translate them. If the code gets modified,
# run make-messages.py -a to update all message files.
#
# You also need to specify the CHARSET of message file, at least. Usually
# UTF-8 will be fine, the line would read like:
#
#   "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
#
# Once finishing the translation, run the following to compile
#
#   $ PYTHONPATH=/path/to/googleappengine/lib/django/ /path/to/googleappengine/lib/django/django/bin/compile-message.py
#
# Django's i18n can decide language per user. Normally it will be done by
# using LocaleMiddleware. Since we don't run entire Django framework, we need
# to deal it on our own, that is the util.I18NRequestHandler (read util.py in
# this project directory).
